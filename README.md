# Ki.KD-TypeScript

This is a TypeScript implementation of [KD (Ki Declarative)](<https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)>). It is the first implementation that has a parser written from scratch (i.e. no ANTLR grammar.)

This implementation is about 95% complete and has tests. The remaining work is the implementation of temportal types and blobs.
