# Ki.KD-TypeScript
This is a TypeScript implementation of [KD (Ki Declarative)](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)). It is the first implementation that has a parser written from scratch (i.e. no ANTLR grammar.) 

This implementation is about 90% complete and has tests. The remaining work is the implementation of ranges, temportal types and blobs.
